# Envirotech


Envirotech is a website dedicated to providing communities around the country with up-to-date, 
easy to digest information on the environmental impacts of projects happening near them. 
As our country continues to expand and more and more infrastructure is built, 
it is our duty as citizens to educate ourselves on the impact of these developments so that we can make informed appeals if necessary.

## UX
A number of careful considerations were made when designing this site. 

### To begin, our problem was defined as follows: 
- Construction is booming and more and more infrastructure is popping up across the country. As it stands, the general public have 
the oppertunity to voice their concerns/opinions on the building of such projects  (for examlpe, a road near their house). 
Engineering firms often hold 'public consultations' at which members of the public can discuss concerns. However, most people 
are left in the dark in terms of the projected impacts the project will have on them and their environment. Their only option 
is to read long, complex environmental assessments not designed for the general public. If people had access to this information 
in a way that they understood, it would help them make much more informed decisions about what will happen in their area in terms of construction. 
This level of transparency will help people feel more comfortable about new projects.
- Engineering firms often face appeals that might have already been addressed in their assessments. Directing the public to a website like 
Envirotech will help reduce the number of these kind of appeals.  

The audience for this website: The general public (specifically those who might struggle to understand complex environmental accessments)

### User Stories 
-------------------------
I am a local farmer with a large amount of land. I have heard that a large motorway might be built near my farm. I am concerned 
about how this might impact my farm. I want to know more about this project so that I can make an informed appeal if i need to.

I can go on Envirotech, look for the project in my area, and view an easy display of information about the project and how 
it might impact me, my animals, and the people around me. I can sign up to an email list so I know when the public consultation will 
be happening. If i don't see my project there, I can submit a form and the Envirotech team can look into it for me and get the information
as soon as possible. 

-------------------------

-------------------------
I am a mother of two who runs a busy schedule. There are plans to build a new bridge on my route to dropping the kids to school. 
I am concerned about traffic disruptions in the area. 

I can go on Envirotech and under the Human health and population section, I will find information about possible traffic disruptions and
how I can plan ahead. If I have any questions, I can fill out the contact us form on the website and someone will get back to me.

## Design 

The nature of the webiste heavily informed design decisions 

### Color Scheme 
This is an informative website - not designed to sell or grab attention while also not looking too plain. The color scheme was choosen 
as simple, environment related, and not to distract from the information but rather to dress it up slightly. 

### Fuctionality 
The user journey is designed to be as simple to understand as possible (given that the user could potentially be someone completely unfamiliar with technology)
Buttons are large and descriptive, the benefits and function of the website are clearly laid out on the home page. 

To catch the younger audience and potentially build awareness, social media links are included throughout the website. However, 
they are not the main focus as the anticipated audience is over 30 (home owner, community active). 


## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Infographic - The interactive infographic at the top of the miain page allows the users to gain a good basic understanding 
of the various stages a construction project will go through and at what point they can have their say. 

Contact us - Allows the user to fill out a form and get in touch with Envirotech 

Website explaination - The 4 sectioned 'How does Envirotech work' gives the user a breakdown of how and why the website is valuable to them

Explore project - Allows the user to access detailed information on the project (broken down into sections they can understand)

Email Alerts - 'Notify about public consultations' button allows the user to sign up for alerts relating to a particular project 

Share - Interactive share button allows the users to access the company's social media pages 

...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
